Upgrade Instructions
--------------------

1. Plugins

1.1 inlinepopups
- Ensure Umbraco skin is maintained
- Check for any changes to the Clearlook2 skin and port over
  (NB: If the Clearlook2 skin hasn't changed, the Umbraco skin shouldn't need to either)

1.2 umbracolink
- Apply any changes that were applied to the default advLink plugin

1.3 umbracoimg
- Apply any changes that were applied to the default advImg plugin
- Make sure you keep the existing settings (width/height/modal window location)

1.4 umbracocontextmenu
- Ensure ConextMenu item data hasn't moved internally (menu.items[n].settings)

2. Themes
The Umbraco theme is based off the Advanced theme which is included with TinyMCE.
You will need to sync the changes made to the Advanced theme, while keeping the Umbraco-specific code.

- Update the "langs" folder. Make sure to replace "advanced" with "umbraco" in each file.
- Update editor_template.js to correctly inject the external toolbar in the Umbraco UI
- Update the .html dialog files
    - Head will contain a custom base-path & possibly encoding
    - The Action Panel will contain custom markup surrounding the buttons. Make sure the buttons are up-to-date.
    - Some labels are hardcoded in the Umbraco version
