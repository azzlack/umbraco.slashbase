uBase
=================

/Base 2.0 for Umbraco 4.7 and upwards

### What about [uRest](http://urest4umb.codeplex.com/)? ###
uBase does not replace uRest, but it certainly could. Look for this functionality in the next version.


### Getting started ###
Take a look in the [wiki](https://github.com/azzlack/umbraco.slashbase/wiki), it should have all the information you need.
